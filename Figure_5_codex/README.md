## Subtyping

## Niche calling

## Spatial stats

The main goal of this notebook is to test as directly as possible the inter-cellular distance between each epithelial celltype and the cells composing the immune and stromal microenvironment. The test can be described in several steps:

Begin by defining a `query` cell type and a `target` cell type. We will be asking about the distance separating `query` from `target`. 


## Subtype enrichment within niches
```
Test this contingency table:

                    in query niche  |  in other niche
                   -----------------|-----------------
   target subtype |        A        |        B        |
------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
reference subtype |        C        |        D        |
                   -----------------|-----------------
